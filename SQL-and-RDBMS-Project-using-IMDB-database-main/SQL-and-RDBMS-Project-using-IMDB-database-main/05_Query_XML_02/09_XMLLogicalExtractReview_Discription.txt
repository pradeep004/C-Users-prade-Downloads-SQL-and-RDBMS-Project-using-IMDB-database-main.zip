We have one table called Review
Review table has two columns movie id and review 
review column is of xml type - where name,comment and rating by a user is stored 
IN this query we are extracting each field data and showing in the form of table for a pertiuclar movie 
Lets consider you enter the movie name , then this query extracts all the names and comments , ratings by differnt user for that perticualr movie 
and it shows in the form of table from xml 

meets the requirement - shwoing fields of xml and non field in the table form
